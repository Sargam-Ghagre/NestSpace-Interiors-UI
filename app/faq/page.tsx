      {
        id: "faq-1",
        question: "How long does a typical project take?",
        answer:
          "Project timelines vary based on scope. A single room typically takes 4–6 weeks, while whole-home projects can take 3–6 months from concept to completion. We provide a detailed schedule during your initial consultation so you always know what to expect at every stage.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-2",
        question: "What is your design process?",
        answer:
          "Our process has four phases: (1) Discovery — an in-depth consultation to understand your lifestyle, preferences, and budget; (2) Concept Development — mood boards, space planning, and material selections; (3) Design Refinement — detailed drawings, 3D visualisations, and client revisions; and (4) Project Execution — sourcing, procurement, and on-site coordination through to final styling and handover.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-3",
        question: "How many revision rounds are included?",
        answer:
          "Every project includes two full revision rounds during the design phase. Additional revisions beyond that are billed at our standard hourly rate. We find that most clients are happy with the direction well before the second round.",

  {
    category: "Services & Working With Us",
    items: [
      {
        id: "faq-4",
        question: "Do you work with clients remotely?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely. We offer virtual consultations and can work with clients anywhere in the country through video calls, shared digital mood boards, and detailed 3D visualisations. Many of our most successful projects have been completed entirely online.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-5",
        question: "Which types of spaces do you design?",
        answer:
          "We design residential and commercial spaces of all sizes — from single rooms and modular kitchens to entire apartments, luxury villas, and corporate offices. Visit our Services page for a full breakdown of what we offer.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-6",
        question: "Can I hire you just for a consultation?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We offer standalone one-hour and two-hour advisory sessions. These are ideal if you want expert guidance on colour palettes, furniture layout, or purchasing decisions without committing to a full design package.",
      },

  // ── Pricing & Payments ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    category: "Pricing & Payments",
    items: [
      {
        id: "faq-7",
        question: "How are your design fees structured?",
        answer:
          "We offer three fee models depending on project type: a flat project fee (most common for full-service projects), an hourly rate for consultations and smaller tasks, and a cost-plus model for procurement-heavy projects where we source and purchase on your behalf. Your proposal will clearly state which model applies and why.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-8",
        question: "What is your payment schedule?",
        answer:
          "A 30% deposit is due upon signing the design agreement. A further 40% is invoiced at the design approval milestone, and the remaining 30% is collected upon project completion. For longer projects, payments may be split into additional milestones — we'll outline this in your contract.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-9",
        question: "Do you have a minimum project budget?",
        answer:
          "Our full-service interior design projects typically start at $25,000 (excluding furniture and materials). For smaller scopes — such as a single room refresh or an advisory session — there is no minimum. Reach out and we'll recommend the right engagement level for your needs.",

  {
    category: "Materials & Sourcing",
    items: [
      {
        id: "faq-10",
        question: "Do you have trade access to exclusive brands?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Our studio has trade accounts with leading furniture, lighting, fabric, and tile manufacturers that are not available to the general public. This means you get access to exclusive products and trade pricing that we pass on to you.",
      },
      {
        id: "faq-11",
        question: "Can I supply my own furniture or materials?",
        answer:
          "Of course. Client-supplied items are incorporated into the design at no extra charge. We do ask that you share specs and lead times early in the process so we can plan around them effectively.",
